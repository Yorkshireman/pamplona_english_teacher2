Teaching Ad site. This is an ongoing journey. Things of note:

- Logged-in users now have access to a 'materials' page where they can download extra materials. The Admin (me) can post new materials to this page. The downloads are done via Dropbox.
- Made User.first a pseudo-admin (it's me)
- My brother designed the logo and the initial look of the page
- I designed the buttons and the style of the Testimonials (Opiniones) section
- I am using Sorcery for user authentication and user sessions
- Users can login and post testimonials
- Paths are setup so users are taken to their desired page when forced to login when trying to go to a page that requires them to be logged in.
- I'm English - I got a Spanish friend to do the translations for me.
- I might turn this into a single-page app at some point.
