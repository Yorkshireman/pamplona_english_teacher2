Teaching Ad site. This is an ongoing journey. Things of note:

- My brother designed the logo and the initial look of the page
- I designed the buttons and the style of the Testimonials (Opiniones) section
- I am using Sorcery for user authentication and user sessions
- Users can login and post testimonials
- Paths are setup so users are taken to their desired page when forced to login when trying to go to a page that requires them to be logged in.
- I'm English - I got a Spanish friend to do the translations for me.
- I will be adding another page soon, which will allow the owner to post links for his/her students to use. For this, I might setup admin and user models and associated permissions.
- I might turn this into a single-page app at some point.
